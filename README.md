My Casino project serves to present my skills that I have acquired through self-study. 
In the creation of this project I used my knowledge, resources from the internet and also cooperation with GPT4 chat.
The backend of the Casino project was written in Python and the Flask library was used.
For the frontend, languages like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT were used. 
The application is also fully responsive.
I have used POSTGRESQL as the database to work with the data. 
Right in the application there is an option to register a player with subsequent saving to the database, logging into the game after verifying that the client is already in the database.
After successful login, it is possible to play one round of BlackJack for a demonstration, where it is possible to enter a rate by selecting from several options.
